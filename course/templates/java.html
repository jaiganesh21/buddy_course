		Introduction to Java
	</h1></u>

	<br>

	


	<h5 style=" margin-left: 45px;">
		JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1991, later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs.
		<br><br>

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.

<h3 style="color: black; margin-left: 20px;"><b>
   History
  </h3></b><br>


<h5 style=" margin-left: 45px;">
Java’s history is very interesting. It is a programming language created in 1991. James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of Sun engineers known as the Green team initiated the Java language in 1991. Sun Microsystems released its first public implementation in 1996 as Java 1.0. It provides no-cost -run-times on popular platforms. Java1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur Van Hoff to strictly comply with its specifications. With the arrival of Java 2, new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.

<br><br>
In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO standards body and later formalized Java, but it soon withdrew from the process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.
<br><br>
On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine as free, open-source software. On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM’s core code available under open-source distribution terms.

<br><br>
The principles for creating java were simple, robust, secured, high performance, portable, multi-threaded, interpreted, dynamic, etc. James Gosling in 1995 developed Java, who is known as the Father of Java. Currently, Java is used in mobile devices, internet programming, games, e-business, etc.

   Java programming language is named JAVA. Why?
  </h3></b><br>

<!-- <br> -->

	<h5 style=" margin-left: 45px;">
		After the name OAK, the team decided to give a new name to it and the suggested words were Silk, Jolt, revolutionary, DNA, dynamic, etc. These all names were easy to spell and fun to say, but they all wanted the name to reflect the essence of technology. In accordance with James Gosling, Java the among the top names along with Silk, and since java was a unique name so most of them preferred it.
<br><br>
Java is the name of an island in Indonesia where the first coffee(named java coffee) was produced. And this name was chosen by James Gosling while having coffee near his office. Note that Java is just a name, not an acronym.

<h3 style="color: black; margin-left: 20px;"><b>
   Java Terminology
  </h3></b><br><br>

<h5 style=" margin-left: 45px;">
  Before learning Java, one must be familiar with these common terms of Java.
</h5>
<br>

	<h3 style="color: black;  margin-left: 20px;"><b>
	1.  Java Virtual Machine(JVM):
	</h3></b><br>

	<h5 style=" margin-left: 45px;">
		 This is generally referred to as JVM. There are three execution phases of a program. They are written, compile and run the program.<br>
     Writing a program is done by a java programmer like you and me.

<br><br>
The compilation is done by the JAVAC compiler which is a primary Java compiler included in the Java development kit (JDK). It takes Java program as input and generates bytecode as output.
<br><br>
In the Running phase of a program, JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler.
<br><br>
Now, we understood that the function of Java Virtual Machine is to execute the bytecode produced by the compiler. Every Operating System has a different JVM but the output they produce after the execution of bytecode is the same across all the operating systems. This is why Java is known as a platform-independent language.
	</h5><br><br>





	<h3 style="color: black;  margin-left: 20px;"><b>
	2. Bytecode in the Development process: 
	</h3></b><br>

	<h5 style=" margin-left: 45px;">
		 As discussed, the Javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM. It is saved as .class file by the compiler. To view the bytecode, a disassembler like javap can be used.
	</h5>
	<br><br>



<h3 style="color: black;  margin-left: 20px;"><b>
		3. Java Development Kit(JDK):
	</h3></b><br>

	<h5 style=" margin-left: 45px;">
		While we were using the term JDK, when we learn about bytecode and JVM . So, as the name suggests, it is a complete Java development kit that includes everything including compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), java debuggers, java docs, etc. For the program to execute in java, we need to install JDK on our computer in order to create, compile and run the java program.
	</h5>
	<br><br>





<h3 style="color: black;  margin-left: 20px;"><b>
	4. Java Runtime Environment (JRE):
	</h3></b><br>

	<h5 style=" margin-left: 45px;">
		JDK includes JRE. JRE installation on our computers allows the java program to run, however, we cannot compile it. JRE includes a browser, JVM, applet supports, and plugins. For running the java program, a computer needs JRE.
	</h5>
	<br><br>





	<h3 style="color: black;  margin-left: 20px;"><b>
		5. Garbage Collector:
	</h3></b><br>

	<h5 style=" margin-left: 45px;">
		In Java, programmers can’t delete the objects. To delete or recollect that memory JVM has a program called Garbage Collector. Garbage Collectors can recollect the of objects that are not referenced. So Java makes the life of a programmer easy by handling memory management. However, programmers should be careful about their code whether they are using objects that have been used for a long time. Because Garbage cannot recover the memory of objects being referenced.
	</h5>
	<br><br>



		<h3 style="color: black;  margin-left: 20px;"><b>
	6. ClassPath:
	</h3></b><br>

	<h5 style=" margin-left: 45px;">
		The classpath is the file path where the java runtime and Java compiler look for .class files to load. By default, JDK provides many libraries. If you want to include external libraries they should be added to the classpath.
